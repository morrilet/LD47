# LD47
A game made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 47.

## Requirements:

* Unity 2019.4.11f1
* Visual Studio (or other C# editor)

## Guidelines for Collaboration

* When working on scene changes, only check in changes to your own testing scene unless _absolutely sure_ that nobody else has changed shared scenes.
* Always check in relevant .meta files. Ensure that your editor settings are set to use `Visible Meta Files` (default.)
* Work on your own branch whenever you're working on something that's likely to require more than one commit.
* Commits / branches should always go to `develop`. `master` is reserved for finished releases.
